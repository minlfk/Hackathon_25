Question Text,Marking Scheme,Example Answer
The founders of On reflect on how their products are perceived by the customers. Provide them with the definition of customer value by relying on the corresponding structural model and naming its main elements.,"Allocation of points:
1P for written definition of customer value (relative perceived customer benefit)
1P for the elements of the structural model (max. 3P)
 Points are given for the following elements of the model
(1P is per main element and 0.5P per secondary element):
- Customer value = relative perceived benefit – relative perceived cost (1P)
- Relative perceived benefit=perceived benefit of alternatives + perceived benefits (1P)
- Relative perceived cost = perceived cost of alternatives + perceived costs (1P)
- Behavioral outcomes = willingness to pay, repeat purchase, WoM advertising (1P)
- Satisfaction/perceived benefit = expectations and performance (0.5P)
- Perceived costs = perceived tangible and intangible costs (0.5P)","Customer value (value for the customer) => price/willingness to pay
Relative perceived benefit is compared to relative perceived costs => if the relative perceived customer value is sufficiently high (benefit > costs) => behavioral outcome: buy"
Define the customer value of On shoes based on information in the case.,"Allocation of points:
2P for meaningful definition of customer value of On
 2P if the relation between relative perceived benefit and relative perceived costs is
clear; it is necessary to illustrate the solution with concrete examples or information
from the case at hand (otherwise max. 1P).
 1P per meaningful element of the customer value. The following elements are accepted:
superior quality, distinct design and lifestyle, sportiness, uniqueness, comfort / walking on clouds, technology / innovation, community feeling, etc.
 0.5P if provided explanation is vague","Quality running shoe with superior characteristics compared to competition;
distinct design and lifestyle that differs from competing products"
What is the value chain of On shoes? Provide an outline with the key elements,1P per meaningful element of (and order in) the value chain (max. 4P),"research/development/innovation => design => raw material/procurement => production =>
packaging => transport/distribution/logistics => stocking/storage => marketing/events =>
wholesale/sales/retail => after sales service/customer support
Not accepted:
Activities placed in the wrong order; synonymous activities or repeated mentioning of the
same activity; elements that are not an activity or not regularly executed in the value chain."
What are the advantages and disadvantages of setting up your own production? Provide at least two arguments each.,"2P for two advantages (1P each)
2P for two disadvantages (1P each)","""+ full control over production/product quality
+ less contractual negotiations with partners/less transaction costs
+ no dependencies from handing over/outsourcing to supplier/independence
+ less risk of being copied or having one’s fabrication process stolen
+ knowledge and expertise stay in the organization
+ flexibility of production/changes can be made instantly
+ possible economies of scope/learning by doing economies
+ developing new competencies
+ quick reaction to problems arising in production
- higher costs for coordination and expertise/higher organizational costs
- increasing complexity
- requires the build-up of competences/knowledge
- capital intensive/resource intensive
- reduced flexibility due to fixed assets
- costs of hierarchical coordination within the organization
- reduced focus on core competences/decreasing specialization
- no risk sharing with suppliers/increased risk
- more employees/increased labor cost
- missing out on the expertise/efficiency/scale of specialized partners
Partly accepted (if disadvantage/advantage is clearly explained/justified):
+/- economies of scale; more expensive/higher production costs/costs in general; lower quality
Not accepted (because of vagueness or lack of generalizability/reasoning):
Own production (insourcing) = better quality / better image / no scandals / more transparency / no
focus on core competencies / no specialization / better work environment / easier innovation / shorter
way of communication / higher competition / not enough demand / location-boundedness / higher
profits / higher added value (requires specification)"

least two specifications each.","2P for criteria (1P each)
2P for meaningful specifications (0.5P each)","Socio-demographic
=> income, willingness to pay, buying power, budget, gender, age, occupation etc.

Geographic
=> urban, rural; mountain/alpine, city; Europe, Asia, USA etc.
Psychographic
=> modern, traditional, environmentalist etc.
Partly accepted:
0.5P for synonyms of “motive/needs-based” (usage, activity, interests, purpose etc.)

0.5P for activity-related features, when presented as a need (durability, waterproof, etc.)
Max. 0.5P each if specifications are not really different/based on same/similar criterion
Not accepted:
- Product features like price or quality that are not related to a specific need or motive
(not accepted as specifications for need/motive)
- Correct specifications of another criterion cited under the wrong criterion (e.g. psychographic criterion => age and gender: 1P for psychographic, 0P for age and gender)
- Geographic specification with rough/smooth soil; rough terrain is a characteristic of the
soil and does not describe a place in itself (urban or rural area/country etc.)
- Psycho-demographic"
"Develop a positioning for On in the market for leisure shoes. Present this positioning
in the form of a semantic differential with at least four characteristics.","Allocation of points:
1P per meaningful semantic differential and positioning (otherwise max. 0.5P)","Example solution:

"For the founding team, the question of expansion into the market for tennis shoes
arises. What form of expansion of the product range is under consideration here?
Base your answer on the framework for program or assortment policy decisions.","Allocation of points:
1P for depth of product range + 1P for product differentiation or
1P for breadth of range + 1P for horizontal diversification
 Only the above-mentioned wording and combination is accepted.
In both cases, an explanation must be provided. Otherwise: max. 0.5P","Example solution: - It is an expansion of depth of product range, more precisely a product differentiation because the problem to be solved by the product remains the same (having adequate footwear to do sports). - It is an expansion of breadth of range, more precisely a horizontal diversification because the new product offering solves a different problem (but on the same level in the value chain or on the same performance level)."
How would you estimate the market potential for On tennis shoes? Evaluate two methodological variants for your estimation.,"Allocation of points: 2P for variants (1P each) 2P for meaningful evaluation/explanation of the variants (1P each)  Evaluation/explanation of variants must be provided to get all points (qualitative; quantitative: primary/secondary)
Partly accepted alternative approach:
Max. 2P for meaningful estimation of the market potential (which was not expected) when:
- The calculation contains at least three steps.
- The overall approach makes sense/is clear.
No extra points for estimations of several markets and market volumes.","Primary market research: generating new data (e.g. on trends, needs, market volume) => can be tailored to specific needs; probably more expensive Secondary market research: analyzing pre-existing data => can be done quickly and inexpensive; however, probably not as specific as tailored data collection

alternative approach: estimation of the market potential for the Swiss market
Market capacity:
=> There are around 8 million inhabitants in Switzerland.
=> Elderly and young children do not actively practice any kind of sport; 6 million remaining
=> 50% actively practice any kind of sports; 3 million remaining
=> 10% play tennis on a regular basis: total of 300,000 people
Market potential:
=> Assumption that only 20% are willing to pay a relatively high price for their tennis shoes
=> Market potential of 60,000 people"
Outline the distribution system of On by including the different channels and intermediaries as provided in the case.,1P per meaningful element of the description/sketch/distribution system (max. 4P) 0.5P for general statements on elements without direct relation to the system  No points when no element mentioned or no description of the system,Producing partner companies in Vietnam => logistics handled by Kühne+Nagel => local store networks/dealers => consumers Partly accepted (0.5P): - Describing the strategic option of the distribution system as selective - Describing the distribution system as indirect sale system - Naming supporting distribution elements - When an element of the channel is partly described (e.g. just “producer”) Not accepted (no extra points): - Double reference to a single element (e.g. “dealer” and “retailer”) - Activities not related to the elements of the distribution system (e.g. “acquisitions”) - System with channels is not clear (e.g. visually not clear) - Explanations why the channel is selective - Wrong answers (e.g. “there are no intermediaries”)

Outline the most important influences of the environment and its stakeholders on On in a system view. Select at least four elements and describe at least two feedback loops.,1P per element of the system/network (max. 4P)  Refers to stakeholders/environments in SGMM 1P per meaningful feedback loop (max. 2P)  Refers to systematic network/impact analysis,Example solution: e.g. unhappy employee => worse product/service => less sales => less revenue => worse working conditions => unhappy employees e.g. problem with supplier => hurts long-term cooperation => loss of trust => cooperation more difficult => more problems with supplier
What conclusions do you draw for On from this system analysis? Name at least two insights.,1P for clear deduction from system analysis above (consistency required) 1P per insight (max. 2P),e.g. keep employees happy/great place to work to maintain high service quality e.g. increasing market share leading to self-fulfilling growth of sales e.g. price is dependent on various factors: on competitors’ positioning and the existing room for differentiation and on production and shipping costs
On is considering the extension of its product range to tennis shoes. What type of decision is involved? Base your answer on three characteristics of the decision.,"1P for the decision type 1P per meaningful characteristic of the decision type (max. 3P)  No points for characteristics that do not fit; with several answers, highest-scoring variant is considered","- Complex decision: uncertain/changing environment, unclear/unknown opponents, systemic feedback loops, unstable goals/variants, unpredictable outcome (4P) - Bounded rationality decision: unconscious violation of rationality, limited information and cognitive skills, uncertainty and risk often unclear/unclarified (4P) Alternative solutions (partly accepted with meaningful arguments):  Program policy decision: extension of product range; horizontal diversification or product differentiation, depending on argumentation (1P for decision, up to 3P for meaningful explanation)  Strategic decision: strategic because it is about generating competitive advantage, because economies of scope are utilized, because of the strategic significance of the segment, etc. (1P for decision, up to 3P for meaningful explanation)  Positioning/segmentation/targeting decision: fundamental shift of positioning when entering a new market segment/target market with tennis shoes (1P for decision; up to 3P for meaningful explanation)"
With which method(s) would you process the decision? Briefly explain your suggested method(s) and selection.,Allocation of points: 1P for a meaningful method/decision rule 2P for a meaningful explanation of the selected method  Consistency between a) and b) is required.,"Scenario planning method: developing different scenarios and development paths to address complex decisions; ongoing reviewing and possibly dynamic adjusting of the plan/targets/variants, etc. Heuristics: adopting simplified rules to approach the complex decision or a decision under bounded rationality and make the project manageable despite its many uncertainties; e.g. trial and error, avoid worst case, etc. Alternative solutions:  If there is consistency with a), alternative solutions are (partially) accepted. Up to 2P if suggested method consists of a strategy framework (SWOT, Porter’s five forces, etc.), a market research method (qualitative, quantitative, etc.), a problem-solving process (with several meaningful steps), etc."
Develop two variants of a corporate structure for On in the form of a divisional organization and in the form of a matrix organization.,3P per organizational structure with meaningful elements (max. 6P)  The organizational structure/sketch needs to be linked to the case,"Divisional structure: Divisions can be structured by regions or products or customers; central functions must be included/considered In each division: development, marketing, sales, finance, HR, IT; each division should have same subdivisions/functions - Matrix structure: Matrix can be structured by divisions, regions, products, and functions Combination/visualization of X- and Y-axis must be meaningful"
Which of the two variants would you choose and why? Provide at least two arguments.,1P per reason (max. 2P) 1P for meaningful conclusion/explanation,"Divisional structure: + simpler structures, economies of scale, more focused (innovation), easier to sell fractions (company within company), etc. - further from regional markets, risk of divisional silos, double work, higher resource intensity, etc. - Matrix structure: + close to the regional markets, more customer centric, etc. - resource intensive, complex structure with two superiors (on X- and Y-axis), etc. => Selection of either matrix or division structure, based on arguments above."
Design a strategy for On based on the idea of competitive advantage. Classify the strategy into a strategy framework of your choice (e.g. Ansoff or BCG matrix).,3P for illustration of framework (e.g. two axes and specifications) 0.5P per axis and specification (max. 3P) 1P for explanation/classification of designed/selected strategy (related to framework) 0.5P each if the specification or axis is described text form  synonyms (e.g. old for existing) are accepted; subsequent errors are considered,"Possible strategies based on Ansoff matrix: - e.g. diversification: diversifying into the market for tennis shoes, hiking boots, etc. - e.g. product development: further innovation of their cloud-technology - e.g. market penetration (entering an existing market with an existing product) - e.g. Ansoff framework focuses on strategy for growth (product differentiation)

> Possible strategies based on BCG matrix:
- e.g. moving from question mark to star: increasing the market share in the growth
market for high-end running shoes
- BUT: On is not a cash cow since it is explicitly stated in the case that the market is
still growing strong. It is also not (yet) a star since on is a very small player in comparison to Nike and Adidas

> Possible strategies based on Porter:
- e.g. differentiation: provide unique running experience/comfort
- e.g. cost leadership: must be well explained, as others might have advantages here
- e.g. focus on strategic advantage: focus on people with specific/special needs…"
Is your strategy based on an inside-out or an outside-in perspective of the firm? Provide a brief explanation.,"2P for classification and meaningful explanation max. 1P if there is just a correct definition, 1.5P if definition includes strategy; max. 1P if the classification is wrong but the explanation is meaningful","- Inside-out: resource-based view => resource configuration; core competences, resources - Outside-in: market-based view => marked positioning; positioning towards customers (brand), positioning in (attractive future) segments (market shares) => Brand image can be both inside-out (resource) or outside-in (position in the market) and requires meaningful explanation"
What changes in management style can be expected as On grows and consolidates? Classify the change by relating it to a scheme of leadership styles,"4P if the leadership style in start-up phase and the leadership with growth is named, the characteristics of each style are explained and a good reasoning why this change is expected is provided (0.5P for each style named, 1P each for the explanation of the characteristics of the styles and 1P for direction and meaningful explanation; 2P for a complete drawing of the leadership-continuum/framework)","Start-up phase: Participative to democratic: joint decisions in the team; relational: one knows each other, works goal-oriented out of mutual responsibility; theory Y; important instruments: group decisions and information, tangible joint responsibility Growth phase: Participative to patriarchal: management team makes central decisions: leads employees; tendency towards transactional management: work is done with defined and monitorable goals; theory X, town hall meetings, information, role model function, coaching, leadership principles, selection of suitable employees Accepted variants/concepts: Leadership-continuum E.g.: During the startup phase primarily democratic leadership style, during growth phase more participative or even patriarchal leadership style. Transactional versus Transformational E.g.: As On growths, its leadership style might change from a transformational style to a more transactional style. This is due to a higher complexity with more people working for on. Individual attention is harder to achieve, therefore systematic feedback is needed. Theory X versus Theory Y E.g.: As On growths, there is a risk/chance, that people are less intrinsically motivated/commited, which means that leadership could shift from participation to control, from delegation and decentralization to more hierarchical and centrally instructed decision making."
Describe at least two consequences for personnel management as a result of this expected growth and consolidation.,1P per meaningful consequence for an element of personnel management (max. 2P)  Important that answer is from a personnel management point of view! “More people work for On” is insufficient; what is the implication for personnel management?
